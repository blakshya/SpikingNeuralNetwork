# SNN
My implementation of a Spiking Neural Network capable of unsupervised and partially supervised learning.

a5.py has the main ideas which are then refactired into a more modular format into snn_funcn.py

The graphing methid is very time consuming. To train on larger datasets, try turning off the graphs, or maybe reduce the time interval for updating the heatmaps. This might not be an issue for training on iris.

This code was a part of an assignment for course ELL741: Neuromorphic Engineering. 

Implementing algorithim described in: [A simple and efficient SNN and its performance & robustness evaluation method to enable hardware implementation,  arXiv:1612.02233v1 ]. The submission also included Diehl and Cook's method. Not uploading it here.

# SNN
My implementation of a Spiking Neural Network capable of unsupervised and partially supervised learning.



This was a part of an assignment for course ELL741: Neuromorphic Engineering. 

Implementing algorithim described in: [A simple and efficient SNN and its performance & robustness evaluation method to enable hardware implementation,  arXiv:1612.02233v1 ]. The submission also included Diehl and Cook's method. Not uploading it here.
